## Android-Controlled Arduino
It is possible to control an Arduino board via an Android application. This could definitely be a fun idea to explore, as it would allow me to keep up with my Android programming as well as learning more about low-level programming. Also, I already have a "Funduino" (aka a knockoff Arduino) as well as an Android device so cost is a low barrier to entry. I would need to get a few parts however, but they appear to be quite cheap on Ebay.
