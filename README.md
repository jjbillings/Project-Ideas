Repository containing ideas for projects that I have, along with links to (possibly) useful resources.

## Android-Controlled Arduino
It is possible to control an Arduino board via an Android application. This could definitely be a fun idea to explore, as it would allow me to keep up with my Android programming as well as learning more about low-level programming. Also, I already have a "Funduino" (aka a knockoff Arduino) as well as an Android device so cost is a low barrier to entry. I would need to get a few parts however, but they appear to be quite cheap on Ebay.

## DIY 8-Bit Computer
Ever since I took CSC220 - Computer Systems Concepts, I've been kind of fascinated with building my own computer. As I see it now, there are two pretty accessible mediums for doing so:
1) In software, using a circuit simulator
2) With hardware.
I think I would rather create it using actual hardware. I spend enough time in front of my computer, that it may be nice to have something hands-on to work on. The downside to this is that ordering parts takes time and I'm liable to fry a ton of components in the process.

In all honesty though, this may be a bit beyond my skill level right now. I could definitely learn, but that might be more time than I have available to commit.
